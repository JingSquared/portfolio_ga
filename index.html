      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an Experience Designer, with a passion for Information Architecture, Process Flows and problem solving. My fascination with business systems and love for creating delightful experiences has led me to pursue a career where I can collaborate with multi-disciplinary teams, to deliver delightful human-centred solutions.
        My origins in design-thinking were forged in the busiest of Chinese restaurants. I was tasked with designing the processes and interactions of the entire service experience through multiple touchpoints, and this sparked an unending fascination within the field of Service Design; a goal I am intent on following throughout my career.
        A background in politics and real estate has further equipped me with strong negotiation skills, empathy for customers, and the ability to listen and communicate effectively with stakeholders in all settings.
        I bring a growth mindset and inquisitive nature, coupled with a diligent and determined passion towards execution. I am excited to continue to grow my knowledge, and look forward to new opportunities that challenge.</p>
